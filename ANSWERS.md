## Questions

Go to `localhost:3000/teachers` in your browser; why does this not work?
There is no GET route to /teachers only /teachers/new

What type of request did your browser just perform?
My browser performed a GET request

Go back to `localhost:3000/teachers/new`; submit the form again. What URL do you end up at?
I've ended up at the form submitting page on localhost:3000/teachers/new.

Why does `localhost:3000/teachers` work now?
Because the form was submitted and the POST route brings us to localhost:3000/teachers
